## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder (`day1`, `day2`, ..., `day9`) includes:
- `index.html` (or similarly named): HTML markup for that day's exercise.
- Corresponding `.css` file(s): Styles for layouts, hover effects, transitions, responsive grids, etc.

- **Day 4–6**: Advanced layouts—responsive grids, positioning, container queries.
- **Day 7–9**: Interactivity—hover effects, animations, transitions, design polish.
